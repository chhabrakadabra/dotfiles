# Abhin's Dotfiles

Setup the dotfiles using the script in `bin/dotfiles`. After the first time the
script is run, it is placed in the executable path and can be directly run as
`dotfiles`.

Note that in order for things to work correctly, you have to install `ansible`
beforehand (use `pip install ansible`).
